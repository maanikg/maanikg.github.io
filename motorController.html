						<h2>The self-made brains of a car</h2>

					<p>As part of UTSM's Prototype Powertrain team, I'm currently implementing a <t
							style="font-weight: bold;"> 22V motor controller unit </t>for the Prototype car which
						will
						compete in the 2024 Shell Eco-Marathon Americas
						Competition. The design for this car's motor controller is entirely new because it will fit
						in
						the team's first fully electric car. Due to competition regulations, the motor control unit
						must
						be fully self-designed.

								<h3>Layout planning</h3>
							</header>
							<p>In the inital planning stages, a previous iteration of the motor controller PCB was used
								to
								create a model for how our motor controller would work. The choice to use a PCB was made
								on the basis that the system needed to be small to fit inside a one-passenger racecar,
								and because it would be able to supply high power. Using a combination of encoders,
								drivers, an Arduino microcontroller, and other components, I started work on the motor
								controller by designing the PCB layout using <t style="font-weight: bold;">Altium
									Designer</t>.</p>

								<h3>Material Sourcing</h3>
							</header>
							<p>A big challenge when planning our PCB design was ensuring that it could actually be
								ordered (ie. the components were available). When transitioning from the initial layout
								design to the PCB schematic and planning, we had to translate the generic components
								(like diodes) to actual part numbers that could be readily sourced. Furthermore, it was
								important to ensure our design cost much less than the <t style="font-weight: bold;">
									$500 budget </t> provisioned for the
								Prototype Powertrain divison if we needed multiple design iterations.

								<h3>Redesign of PCB</h3>
							</header>
							<p>As we further progressed with the design of the PCB, we realized that with the high
								voltage that we were dealing with (as high as 44V at times), the components we were
								using would not be able to sustain such high voltage. The decision was taken to split
								the PCB into 2 main sections: one responsible for power conversion (which would handle
								the high voltage) and the other part which would contain the rest of the components.
								This would streamline the design process and allow for the isolation of issues during
								testing. </p>
							<p>At the moment, the design of the 2 PCB sections is complete, and we are in the process of
								ordering them.</p>

						<h2>Future Development Steps</h2>
					</header>
					<p>With the PCB designs nearly complete, the team will order the completed PCBs in the next few
						weeks. In the meantime, I will implement the C++ code that is need to control the 3 phases of
						encoders and drivers via the Arduino microcontroller. After the PCBs have arrived, the priority
						is to ensure that our
						current design works with the rest
						of the electrical system and diagnose any weaknesses or issues with the rest of the Prototype
						team.</p>
