						<h2>A real-time speech teacher</h2>
					</header>
					<p>With various front-end projects under my belt, I wanted to try my hand at mobile development.
						Additonally, <a href="thermaSave.html"> thermaSave</a> had piqued my interest in machine
						learning, and I wanted to dive deeper into the application of machine learning models.<br>
						Speech is something that has many attributes that can be measured and quantified such as tone,
						volume, speed, etc., and I was
						interested in seeing if I could build machine learning models on my own that could analyze
						speech and provide feedback based on those models. Thus, the idea for helloMilo was born. Check
						out
						the <a href="https://github.com/maanikg/helloMilo">helloMilo source code here</a>.
						<br>(The name for helloMilo comes from 'hello' and 'Milo' - derived from the Greek word 'μιλώ'
						or
						'miló', which means to speak.)

								<h3>Navigating a maze</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Since it was our first time undertaking a major mobile app project, we started desiging
								the layout of the app (ie. how the pages would connect to each other, and where
								information needed to be shared). Since I was working with a language and framework I
								had never used before (Swift and SwiftUI), it took time to get up to speed with the
								development of the app.<br><br>
								The image to the left shows the initial layout of the app, and how the pages would
								connect with each other. For instance, the recording and scores screen can be seen.

								<h3>Training models</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The bulk of the project hinged on getting machine learning models to accurately detect
								different attributes of speech. I found that there were not many
								machine learning models already available suited for speech attributes we were
								looking for.
								However, through Apple's machine learning development platform <t
									style="font-weight: bold;">CreateML</t>, I was able to feed audio clips of various
								categories in order to train and create machine learning models. This became the
								backbone of how we would detect the quality of speech attributes such as tone, volume,
								speed, etc. Seen right is a audio classification model being created and trained using
								CreateML.

								<h3>Models to Feedback</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Once the models were created and their accuracy verified, the task was to apply the
								models to the user's speech in real-time. The analysis worked by taking 5 second clips
								at a time every 2.5 seconds, and applying the model to predict the estimated
								quality of speech; this process allowed for a seamless analysis of the entire audio.
								Furthermore, even though the models didn't fully know what speech was and couldn't
								identify the words themselves, by taking short clips at a time, they could pick up on
								general trends in tone, speed, volume, etc.<br><br>
								Through this process, we were able to quantitatively analyze the user's speech and give
								feedback based on the quality of speech recorded. Seen right is an example of the early
								stages of the scoring system, with more monotone speech being scored lower.

						<h2>Future Development Steps</h2>
					</header>
					<p>While the process of creating models and using them to provide feedback was quite
						straightforward, the actual formation of the models was very time-intensive because a variety of
						clips were needed for each speech attribute. For the tone audio classifier model alone, more
						than 60 audio clips were used. Since there is no central database for these audio clips
						categorized by the quality of speech, many clips are simply found by looking at various videos
						through trial and error. As a result, not all speech attribute models have been fully completed.
						The main priority in the future is to completely finish the remaining models.<br><br>
						In addition, saving user information in the cloud would enable for more personalized feedback
						based on prior recordings. This would be a great way to track progress and provide more accurate
						feedback.
