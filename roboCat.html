						<h2>Not your ordinary cat</h2>
					</header>
					<p>roboCat was made during the MakeUofT 2023 hackathon - a 24-hour hackathon centered around
						hardware and
						physical projects. The hackathon theme we decided to follow for our project was 'useless
						inventions'. Check out the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/robo-cat"> Devpost
							hackathon
							submission link </a> and the <a href="https://github.com/reaahuja/MakeUofT">source
							code</a> for the project.
						<br><br>
						When brainstorming, we decided that making an imitation of a pet would allow for a lot of
						creativity in terms of what features we could add. We ultimately decided to make an autonomous
						pet
						distracter. For the hardware aspect, we decided to use
						Arduino as the central controller of the project as the software to run the Arduino was fairly
						simple.
						<br><br>
						This project was created in collaboration with <a
							href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler--yan/">Tyler Yan</a> and two other hackathon team
						members.

								<h3>Feature Planning</h3>
							</header>
							<p>A large amount of time went into what we believed was possible to create with Arduino and
								whether we could physically manifest these ideas in a short amount of time given the
								materials we had. By evaluating the materials we had available, we eventually decided on
								these core functions that would serve as distractions:
							<ul>
								<li>A wheel base with sensors to perform autonomous movement on land (avoiding
									obstacles)</li>
								<li>A laser 'eye' that would move at random</li>
								<li>A speaker that would emit 'meow'-like sounds</li>
								<li>A wagging tail</li>
								<li>An LED display showing various messages</li>
							</ul>

								<h3>A base to work from</h3>
							</header>
							<p>I spent the majority of the time working on the physical structure and the autonomous
								driving. A big challenge was making a structure that could house all the hardware and
								electrical components while still keeping the core functionality in the right places of
								the 'cat'. Additionally, we had to balance weight with sturdiness - the more components
								we added, the less maneuverable it would be. <br><br>
								For the autonomous driving, we used an ultrasonic sensor (seen at the bottom of the
								right image). We used a TT motor to constantly drive and supply power to both rear
								wheels, and cut off power to one of the wheels when we detected there was an obstacle
								using the sensor. Due to a lack of materials, we only had one ultrasonic sensor, one TT
								motor, and two large wheels which could connect to the motor,so we decided to only allow
								forward motion using rear-wheel drive.

								<h3>A cat in motion</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The assembly of the 'cat' was not difficult, but due to the aforementioned lack of
								materials in terms of the wheels, motor, and sensors, we faced difficulties with the
								autonomous driving aspect of the project. Because we only had one motor, as we added
								more mass to the top of the physical structure, the wheels struggled to turn due to the
								weight from above. When all components were added, our motor was only able to overcome
								kinetic friction but could not overcome static friction, leading to the phenomenom where
								our project could not start moving from standstill, but once moving it could stay moving
								for a while. <br><br>
								Regardless, the autonomous driving aspect worked in the sense that it would drive and
								avoid obstacles if there were any detected. The fully finished roboCat project with all
								active components (driving, laser eye, wagging tail, sound noises, and LED display)
								can be seen in the video to the left.

						<h2>Future Development Steps</h2>
					</header>
					<p>While we did the best with the materials we had regarding the driving aspect, the physical
						structure could have been improved by streamlining the different aspects of our project
						together. During development, we used one Arduino for either one or two abilities (driving,
						sounds, laser, etc.), and as a result, the wiring and circuitry was needlessly complex. This
						also may have contributed to an increased weight when, if everything was planned meticulously
						from the start, we could have ommitted one or two Arduino boards to reduce weight. If the
						project
						had to
						be made again, I would probably put a greater focus on the Arduino connections to reduce
						redundancies in hardware and improve the physical structure and driving as a whole.</p>
